        Staaarting the streeeam
        technolate?
        Look, you can't blame me. I was inches from hitting the go live button, then my  door flung open. The super volcano underneath Yellow Stone Park is about to erupt. You gotta believe me.
        Luckily, the stuation is sorted. No ancient volcano is going to stop Technoblade from streaming Minecraft.
        Anyways, the note I got last time said to go here for some free fresh cookies.
        It's a trap?
        Look it could be a trap and I'm ganged up on by 5 people and I lose one of my three lives. Or I could get cookies. I think the benefits vastly outweigh the potential downsides.
        Well Eret's pyramid is just around the corner, I just need to follow the path.

        free cookies???
        technoblade, this structure is so much more then just a place where you can get cookies.
        Can't you understand, its THE 
        great
        almighty
        Penultimate

        Wilbur, have you even been in the pyramid?
        ~displayPortrait("Wilbur", "default")
        ~setTextSound("Wilbur")
        Me? No I haven't
        But that's not important. The moment I saw it 20 minutes ago, I knew it was special.
        One day may it open its magnificent locked doors for all to trensend into the next world

        Its not that man. The problem is that my savior is a pig who has quite literally gone on the record on being an atheist. It just doesn't sit right
